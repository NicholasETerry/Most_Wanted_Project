# Most_Wanted_Project
You have been contracted to build a prototype for a person search for a top-secret government project. You have been given access to an array of objects representing individuals. The prototype should just use window.prompt and window.alert for the User Interface (UI).  All results should be printed through the window.alert and window.prompt. Although this isnâ€™t typical in production, you may use only two files for this project, an HTML file and a JS file for the application.
